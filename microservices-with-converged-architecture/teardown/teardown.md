# Tear down

## Introduction

In this lab, we will tear down the resources created in your tenancy and the directory in the Oracle cloud shell.

Estimates Time: 5 minutes

### Objectives

* Teardown the setup

### Prerequisites

* Have successfully or partially completed lab 1

## Task 1: Delete the Workshop Resources

1. Run the following command to delete the resources created in your tenancy. It will delete everything except the compartment. It will take several minutes to run. The script will delete the database and the compute instance.

    ```
    <copy>teardown</copy>
    ```

## Task 2: Delete the Directory

1. Delete the directory in your cloud shell where you installed the workshop.

    ```
    <copy>rm -rf <directory name></copy>
    ```

## Task 3: Delete the Compartment

1. In the Oracle Cloud Console navigate to the Compartments screen in the Identity section. Select the compartment that was created for the workshop and delete it. Note, even when the script in step 1 has completed execution, it can take some time for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure to fully remove all the resources. It will not be possible to delete the compartment until this has completed execution.
