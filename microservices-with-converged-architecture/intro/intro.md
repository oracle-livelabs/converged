# Introduction

## About this Workshop

This workshop will help you understand the technical capabilities inside the Oracle converged database to support a scalable data and event-driven microservices architecture.

### About Product/Technology

Microservices written in either PL/SQL or JavaScript will be deployed within an Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing database. Web interfaces and messaging are used for communication. A secure Javascript application, running in the browser, will showcase the microservice functionality. Order data is stored as a JSON collection, and Inventory data is stored on relational tables.
