# Introduction

## About this Workshop

[Video Recording of the Simplify Microservices with a 2-tier Converged Database Architecture Workshop](videohub:1_jhwgl9t6)

This workshop will help you understand the technical capabilities inside the Oracle converged database to support a scalable data and event-driven microservices architecture.

### About Product/Technology

Microservices written in either PL/SQL or JavaScript will be deployed within an Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing database. Web interfaces and messaging are used for communication. A secure Javascript application, running in the browser, will showcase the microservice functionality. Order data is stored as a JSON collection, and Inventory data is stored on relational tables.

Estimated Workshop Time: 45 mins

### Objectives

- Learn about the Oracle Database's unique ability to provide native support for modern data types, languages, security, and the latest development paradigms such as JSON for document stores, event queues, and loose coupling.
- Learn about a two-tier microservice architecture - the application tier, and the database tier - bringing agility, scalability, and robustness to enterprise applications.

### Prerequisites

 - An Oracle Cloud Account - Please view this workshop's LiveLabs landing page to see which environments are supported.  This workshop requires a compute instance that is not Always Free and as a result this workshop cannot be completed in an Always Free account.
