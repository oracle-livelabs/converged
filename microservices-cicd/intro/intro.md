# Introduction

## About this Workshop

CI/CD is a key ingredient for agile application development and deployment on the cloud. Tools like Github and Jenkins give DevOps team members the ability to automate an entire end-to-end CI/CD pipeline while Liquibase provides a solution to address database schema change management challenges.

This workshop illustrates how you can leverage the services like Autonomous Database using Jenkins and Liquibase to provide an end-to-end continuous integration and delivery experience.

Estimated Workshop Time: 90 minutes

### About Product/Technology

Helidon microservices with Javascript front-end will be deployed on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Kubernetes cluster (OKE) which will access and Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing database.

Jenkins is hosted on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure to centralize build automation and scale the deployment by using Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Registry and Container Engine for Kubernetes. GitHub is being used for source code management.

### Objectives

* Learn how to automate the continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery and deployment (CD) pipelines for your application development using Jenkins.
* Learn how to host it on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure to centralize build automation and scale the deployment by using Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Registry and Container Engine for Kubernetes.
* Learn how Oracle Database addresses the change management challenges with its tools like SQLcl and Liquibase for managing database change tracking.

### Prerequisites

* An Oracle Cloud Account - Please view this workshop's LiveLabs landing page to see which environments are supported.

 Upcoming versions of this workshop will include the following.
 - Use of Edition-based redefinition (EBR) functionality of Oracle database for enabling online application upgrade with uninterrupted availability of the application. 
 - Integration with GitHub Actions
 - More details on usage and use cases.
 
 The "GrabDish" application and related infrastructure used in the [Simplify Microservices with converged Oracle Database Workshop](http://bit.ly/bettermicroservices) and shown below will be reused for this workshop, however, the focus will be on CI/CD flow. 

We encourage you to check out the other workshop if you are interested in learning more about the technical capabilities inside and outside the Oracle converged database to support scalable data and event-driven microservices architectures, polyglot microservices, data and transaction patterns, etc.

 You may now **proceed to the next lab.**
