# Build CI/CD Pipeline by Using Jenkins and Oracle Cloud Infrastracture

## Introduction

This lab will walk you through CI/CD workflow using the pipeline built in the previous lab.
Estimated Time: 20 minutes

### Objectives

* CI/CD Workflow Walkthrough
  
### Prerequisites

This lab presumes you have already completed the earlier labs.

Pracle Cloud Infrastructure Services, like OKE cluster and the Autonomous Transaction Processing databases that you created in Lab 1, Github

> **Note:** As this is a demonstration of Jenkins/GitHub integration for CI/CD, **you must use your own GitHub account to run it. Please fork or copy the microservices repository into your own GitHub account before continuing `https://github.com/oracle/microservices-datadriven`**.

## Task 1: CI/CD Workflow Walkthrough

1. Connect to cloud shell
    kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
    kubectl get services --all-namespaces

    @cloudshell:grabdish (us-sanjose-1)$ kubectl get pods --all-namespaces

    You are ready to access the frontend page. Open a new browser tab and enter the external IP URL:
    `https://<EXTERNAL-IP>`  
    Note: For convenience a self-signed certificate is used to secure this https address and so it is likely you will be prompted by the browser to allow access.  
    You will be prompted to authenticate to access the Front End microservices. The user is grabdish and the password is the one you entered in Lab 1.  
    Make Application Changes (DevOps experience)  
       - Open Visual Studio Code  
       - Navigate to grabdish/frontend-helidon/...spatial.html  
    <p class="oj-text-color-secondary oj-typography-subheading-xs">Data-driven Microservices with Converged Oracle Databases</p>
    </div>

2. Update the grabdish/frontend-helidon/...version.txt
3. Save all
4. Open Github Desktop
5. Check Repository Setting - `https://github.com/renagranat/microservices-datadriven.git`
6. Save and Push to github Repository
7. Check Jenkins pipeline, observe Jenkins job created â€“ review the log

You may now **proceed to the next lab.**.
