## Task 1: Explore the Kubernetes cluster

Oracle Backend for Spring Boot includes a number of platform services which are deployed into the Oracle Container Engine for Kubernetes cluster.  You configured **kubectl** to access your cluster in an earlier lab.  In this task, you will explore the services deployed in the Kubernetes cluster.  A detailed explanation of Kubernetes concepts is beyond the scope of this course.

1. Explore namespaces

   Kubernetes resources are grouped into namespaces.  To see a list of the namespaces in your cluster, use this command, your output will be slightly different: 

    ```shell
    $ <copy>kubectl get ns</copy>
    NAME                              STATUS   AGE
    admin-server                      Active   11d
    apisix                            Active   5d1h
    application                       Active   11d
    cert-manager                      Active   11d
    cloudbank                         Active   11d
    conductor-server                  Active   11d
    config-server                     Active   11d
    default                           Active   11d
    eureka                            Active   11d
    grafana                           Active   4d9h
    ingress-nginx                     Active   11d
    kafka                             Active   9d
    kube-node-lease                   Active   11d
    kube-public                       Active   11d
    kube-system                       Active   11d
    obaas-admin                       Active   11d
    observability                     Active   11d
    open-telemetry                    Active   11d
    oracle-database-operator-system   Active   11d
    otmm                              Active   9d
    prometheus                        Active   4d9h
    vault                             Active   5d3h
    ```

   Here is a summary of what is in each of these namespaces: 

      * `admin-server` contains Spring Admin which can be used to monitor and manage your services
      * `apisix` contains the APISIX API Gateway and Dashboard which can be used to expose services outside the cluster
      * `application` is a pre-created namespace with the Oracle Database wallet and secrets pre-configured to allow services deployed there to access the Oracle Autonomous Database instance
      * `cert-manager` contains Cert Manager which is used to manage X.509 certificates for services
      * `cloudbank` is the namespace where you deployed the CloudBank sample application
      * `conductor-server` contains Netflix Conductor OSS which can be used to manage workflows
      * `eureka` contains the Spring Eureka Service Registry which is used for service discovery
      * `grafana` contains Grafana which can be used to monitor and manage your environment
      * `ingress-nginx` contains the NGINX ingress controller which is used to manage external access to the cluster
      * `kafka` contains a three-node Kafka cluster that can be used by your application
      * `obaas-admin` contains the Oracle Backend for Spring Boot administration server that manages deployment of your services
      * `observability` contains Jaeger tracing which is used for viewing distributed traces
      * `open-telemetry` contains the Open Telemetry Collector which is used to collect distributed tracing information for your services
      * `oracle-database-operator-system` contains the Oracle Database Operator for Kubernetes which can be used to manage Oracle Databases in Kubernetes environments
      * `otmm` contains Oracle Transaction Manager for Microservices which is used to manage transactions across services
      * `prometheus` contains Prometheus which collects metrics about your services and makes the available to Grafana for alerting and dashboards
      * `vault` contains HashiCorp Vault which can be used to store secret or sensitive information for services, like credentials for example

   Kubernetes namespaces contain other resources like pods, services, secrets and config maps.  You will explore some of these now. 

2. Explore pods

   Kubernetes runs workloads in "pods."  Each pod can container one or more containers.  There are different kinds of groupings of pods that handle scaling in different ways.  Use this command to review the pods in the `apisix` namespace:

    ```shell
    $ <copy>kubectl -n apisix get pods</copy>
    NAME                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS        AGE
    apisix-5b47fcc4-bm25w              1/1     Running   0               6d18h
    apisix-5b47fcc4-h6pbv              1/1     Running   0               6d18h
    apisix-5b47fcc4-zn76k              1/1     Running   0               6d18h
    apisix-dashboard-6957c575f-lfchl   1/1     Running   4 (6d18h ago)   6d18h
    apisix-etcd-0                      1/1     Running   0               6d18h
    apisix-etcd-1                      1/1     Running   0               6d18h
    apisix-etcd-2                      1/1     Running   0               6d18h
    ```

   The first three pods listed are the APISIX API Gateway itself.  These are part of a Kubernetes "deployment".  These share the requests between them.  In OCI, each of these three pods runs in a different availability zone to maximize availability.  The next pod is running the APISIX Dashboard user interface - there is only one instance of that pod running.  And the last three pods are running the etcd cluster that APISIX is using to store its state.  These three pods are part of a "stateful set".

   To see details of the deployments and stateful set in this namespace use this command: 

    ```shell
    $ <copy>kubectl -n apisix get deploy,statefulset</copy>
    NAME                               READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
    deployment.apps/apisix             3/3     3            3           6d18h
    deployment.apps/apisix-dashboard   1/1     1            1           6d18h
    
    NAME                           READY   AGE
    statefulset.apps/apisix-etcd   3/3     6d18h
    ```

   If you want to view extended information about any object you can specify its name and the output format, as in this example:

    ```shell
    $ <copy>kubectl -n apisix get pod apisix-etcd-0 -o yaml</copy>
    ```

3. Explore services

   Kubernetes services are essentially small load balancers that sit in front of groups of pods and provide a stable network address as well as load balancing.  To see the services in the `apisix` namespace use this command: 

    ```shell
    $ <copy>kubectl -n apisix get svc</copy>
    NAME                   TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)             AGE
    apisix-admin           ClusterIP   10.123.66.40    <none>        9180/TCP            6d18h
    apisix-dashboard       ClusterIP   10.123.58.88    <none>        80/TCP              6d18h
    apisix-etcd            ClusterIP   10.123.82.236   <none>        2379/TCP,2380/TCP   6d18h
    apisix-etcd-headless   ClusterIP   None            <none>        2379/TCP,2380/TCP   6d18h
    apisix-gateway         NodePort    10.123.245.40   <none>        80:30801/TCP        6d18h
    ```

   Notice that the services give information about the ports.  You can get detailed information about a service by specifying its name and output format as you did earlier for a pod. 

4. Explore secrets

   Sensitive information in Kubernetes is often kept in secrets that are mounted into the pods at runtime.  This means that the container images do not need to have the sensitive information stored in them.  It also helps with deploying to different environments where sensitive information like URLs and credentials for databases changes based on the environment.

   Oracle Backend for Spring Boot creates a number of secrets for you so that your applications can securely access the Oracle Autonomous Database instance.  Review the secrets in the pre-created `application` namespace using this command. **Note**, the name of the secrets will be different in your environment depending on the application name you gave when deploying the application.

    ```shell
    $ <copy>kubectl -n application get secret</copy>
    NAME                      TYPE                             DATA   AGE
    obaasdevdb-db-secrets     Opaque                           5      10d
    obaasdevdb-tns-admin      Opaque                           8      10d
    registry-auth             kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson   1      10d
    tls-certificate           kubernetes.io/tls                4      10d
    ```

   Whenever you create a new application namespace with the CLI and bind it to the database, these secrets will be automatically created for you in that namespace.  The first one contains the credentials to access the Oracle Autonomous Database.  The second one contains the database client configuration files (`tnsadmin.ora`, `sqlnet.ora`, the keystores, and so on).  The third secret contains the credentials needed to pull container images from your container registry.  And the final secret contains certificates used within Kubernetes to encrypt traffic between pods and to authenticate to the Kubernetes API server. 

   You can view detailed information about a secret with a command like this, you will need to provide the name of your secret which will be based on the name you chose during installation (your output will be different). Note that the values are uuencoded in this output: 

    ```shell
    $ <copy>kubectl -n application get secret obaasdevdb-db-secrets -o yaml</copy>
    apiVersion: v1
    data:
      db.name: xxxxxxx
      db.password: xxxxxxx
      db.service: xxxxxxx
      db.username: xxxxxxx
      secret: xxxxxx
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      creationTimestamp: "2023-02-16T17:27:30Z"
      name: obaasdevdb-db-secrets
      namespace: application
      resourceVersion: "2952562"
      uid: 15110648-65b3-4d71-b749-c0cc9c2a2231
    type: Opaque
    ```

   When you deploy a Spring Boot microservice application into Oracle Backend for Spring Boot, the pods that are created will have the values from this secret injected as environment variables that are referenced from the `application.yaml` to connect to the database.  The `xxxxxx-tns-admin` secret will be mounted in the pod to provide access to the configuration and keystores to allow your application to authenticate to the database.


## Task 2: Explore the Oracle Autonomous Database instance

Oracle Backend for Spring Boot includes an Oracle Autonomous Database instance.  You can manage and access the database from the OCI Console.

1. View details of the Oracle Autonomous Database

   In the OCI Console, in the main ("hamburger") menu navigate to the **Oracle Database** category and then **Oracle Autonomous Database**.  Make sure you have the correct region selected (in the top right corner) and the compartment where you installed Oracle Backend for Spring Boot (in the left hand side pull down list).  You will a list of Oracle Autonomous Database instances (you will probably only have one):

   ![List of OraCle Autonomous Database instances](images/obaas-adb-1.png)

   Click on the database name link to view more information about that instance.  ON this page, you can see important information about your Oracle Autonomous Database instance, and you can manage backups, access and so on.  You can also click on the **Performance Hub** button to access information about the performance of your database instance. 

   ![Details of Oracle Autonomous Database instance](images/obaas-adb-2.png)

   You can manage scaling from here by clicking on the **Manage scaling** button which will open this form where you can adjust the OCPU and storage for the Autonomous Database instance.  

   ![Manage scaling](images/obaas-adb-2a.png)

2. Explore Oracle Backend for Spring Boot database objects

   Click on the **Database Actions** link to go to the "Database Actions" page which lets you access and manage information in the database.  Depending on choices you made during installation, you may go straight to Database Actions, or you may need to enter credentials first.  If you are prompted to login, use the username `ADMIN` and obtain the password from Kubernetes with this command (make sure to change the secret name to match the name you chose during installation): 

    ```shell
    $ <copy> kubectl -n application get secret obaasdevdb-db-secrets -o jsonpath='{.data.db\.password}' | base64 -d</copy>
    ```

   ![Database Actions login page](images/obaas-adb-3.png)

   In the Database Actions Launchpad, click ont **SQL** tile to open an SQL Worksheet.

   ![Database Actions Launchpad](images/obaas-adb-4.png)

   In the SQL Worksheet, you can the first pull down list in the **Navigator** on the left hand side to see the users and schema in the database.  Choose the **CONFIGSERVER** user to view tables (or other objects) for that user.  This is the user associated with the Spring Config Server. 

   Execute this query to view tables associated with various Spring Boot services:

    ```sql
    <copy>select owner, table_name
    from dba_tables
    where owner in ('CUSTOMER', 'FRAUD', 'ACCOUNT',  'USER', 'CONFIGSERVER')</copy>
    ```  

   ![Tables associated with Spring Boot services](images/obaas-adb-5.png)

   Feel free to explore some of these tables to see the data.

## Task 3: Explore Spring Admin

Oracle Backend for Spring Boot includes Spring Admin which provides a web user interface for managing and monitoring Spring applications.

1. Connect to Spring Admin

   Oracle Backend for Spring Boot does not expose management interfaces outside the Kubernetes cluster for improved security.  Oracle recommends you access these interfaces using **kubectl** port forwarding, which creates an encrypted tunnel from your client machine to the cluster to access a specific service in the cluster.

   Open a tunnel to the Spring Admin server using this command:

    ```shell
    <copy>kubectl -n admin-server port-forward svc/admin-server 8989:8989</copy>
    ```

    Open a web browser to [http://localhost:8989](http://localhost:8989) to view the Spring Admin web user interface.

    Click on the **Wallboard** link in the top menu to view the "wallboard" which shows all the discovered services.  Spring Admin discovers services from the Spring Eureka Service Registry. 

   ![Spring Admin Wallboard](images/obaas-spring-admin-1.png)

   Each hexagon represents a service.  Notice that this display gives you a quick overview of the health of your system.  Green services are healthy, grey services have reduced availability and red services are not healthy.  You can also see information about how many instances (i.e. pods) are available for each service.

2. View information about a service

   Click on the **Customer** service.  You will see a detail page like this:

   ![Customer service details](images/obaas-spring-admin-2.png)

   On this page, you can see detailed information about service's health, and you can scroll down to see information about resource usage.  The menu on the left hand side lets you view additional information about the service including its environment variables, the Spring beans loaded, its Spring configuration properties and so on.  You can also access metrics from this interface.

3. View endpoints

   Click on the **Mappings** link in the left hand side menu.  This page shows you information about the URL Path mappings (or endpoints) exposed by this service.  You will notice several endpoints exposed by Spring Actuator, which enables this management and monitoring to be possible.  And you will see your service's own endpoints, in this example the ones that start with `/api/v1/...`:

   ![Customer service endpoint list](images/obaas-spring-admin-3.png)


## Task 4: Explore Spring Eureka Service Registry

Spring Eureka Service Registry is an application that holds information about what microservices are running in your environment, how many instances of each are running, and on which addresses and ports.  Spring Boot microservices register with Eureka at startup, and it regularly checks the health of all registered services.  Services can use Eureka to make calls to other services, thereby eliminating the need to hard code service addresses into other services.

1. Start a port-forward tunnel to access the Eureka web user interface

   Start the tunnel using this command.  You can run this in the background if you prefer.

    ```shell
    $ <copy>kubectl -n eureka port-forward svc/eureka 8761:8761</copy>
    ```

   Open a web browser to [http://localhost:8761](http://localhost:8761) to view the Eureka web user interface.  It will appear similar to the image below.

   ![Eureka web user interface](images/obaas-eureka.png)

   Notice that you can see your own services like the Accounts, Credit Score and Customer services from the CloudBank sample application, as well as platform services like Spring Admin, the Spring Config server and Conductor.

## Task 5: Explore APISIX API Gateway

Oracle Backend for Spring Boot includes APISIX API Gateway to manage which services are made available outside of the Kubernetes cluster.  APISIX allows you to manage many aspects of the services' APIs including authentication, logging, which HTTP methods are accepted, what URL paths are exposed, and also includes capabilities like rewriting, filtering, traffic management and has a rich plugin ecosystem to enhance it with additional capabilities.  You can manage the APISIX API Gateway using the APISIX Dashboard.

1. Access the APISIX Dashboard

   Start the tunnel using this command.  You can run this in the background if you prefer.

    ```shell
    $ <copy>kubectl -n apisix port-forward svc/apisix-dashboard 8081:80</copy>
    ```

   Open a web browser to [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081) to view the APISIX Dashboard web user interface.  It will appear similar to the image below.
   
   If prompted to login, login with username `admin` and password `admin`.  Note that Oracle strongly recommends that you change the password, even though this interface is not accessible outside the cluster without a tunnel.

   Open the routes page from the left hand side menu.  You will see the routes that you defined in earlier labs:

   ![APISIX Dashboard route list](images/obaas-apisix-route-list.png)

1. View details of a route

   Click on the **Configure** button next to the **account** route.  The first page shows information about the route definition.  Scroll down to the **Request Basic Define** section.  Notice how you can set the host, port, paths, HTTP Methods and other information for the API.

   ![APISIX route definition](images/obaas-apisix-route-1.png)

   Click on the **Next** button to move to the **Define API Backend Server** page where you can set the routing/load balancing algorithm, retries, timeout and so on.  On this page you will notice that the upstream service is defined using **Service Discovery** and the discovery type is **Eureka**.  The **Service Name** specified here is the key used to look up the service in the Spring Eureka Service Registry.  APISIX will route to any available instance of the service registered in Eureka.

   ![Configure route](images/obaas-apisix-route-2.png)

   Click on the **Next** button to move to the **Plugin Config** page.  The routes in the CloudBank sample do no use any of the plugins, however you can scroll through this page to get an idea of what plugins are available for your services.

   ![APISIX plugin config](images/obaas-apisix-route-3.png)

   > **Note**: You can find detailed information about the available plugins and how to configure them in the [APISIX documentation](https://apisix.apache.org/docs/apisix/getting-started/) in the **Plugins** section.


## Task 6: Explore Spring Config Server

The Spring Config Server can be used to store configuration information for Spring Boot applications, so that the configuration can be injected at runtime.  It organized the configuration into properties, which are essentially key/value pairs.  Each property can be assigned to an application, a label, and a profile.  This allows a running application to be configured based on metadata which it will send to the Spring Config Server to obtain the right configuration data. 

The configuration data is stored in a table in the Oracle Autonomous Database instance associated with the backend.

1. Look at the configuration data

    Execute the query below by pasting it into the SQL worksheet in Database Actions (which you learned how to open in Task 2 above) and clicking on the green circle "play" icon.  This query shows the externalized configuration data stored by the Spring Config Server.

    ```sql
    <copy>select * from configserver.properties</copy>
    ```  

   ![Configuration data](images/obaas-config-server-table.png)

   In this example you can see there is an application called `fraud`, which has two configuration properties for the profile `kube` and label `latest`.

## Task 7: Explore Grafana

Grafana provides an easy way to access the metrics collected in the backend and to view them in dashboards.  It can be used to monitor performance, as well as to identify and analyze problems and to create alerts.

1. Explore the pre-installed Spring Boot Dashboard 

    Get the password for the Grafana admin user using this command (your output will be different): 

    ```shell
    $ <copy>kubectl -n grafana get secret grafana -o jsonpath='{.data.admin-password}' | base64 -d</copy>
    fusHDM7xdwJXyUM2bLmydmN1V6b3IyPVRUxDtqu7
    ```

   Start the tunnel using this command.  You can run this in the background if you prefer.

    ```shell
    $ <copy>kubectl -n grafana port-forward svc/grafana 8080:80</copy>
    ```

   Open a web browser to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view the Grafana web user interface.  It will appear similar to the image below.  Log in with the username **admin** and the password you just got.

   ![picture](images/obaas-grafana-signin.png)

   In the lower left there is a list of pre-installed dashboards, click on the link to open the **Spring Boot Dashboard**. 

   ![picture](images/obaas-grafana-home-page.png)

   The Spring Boot Dashboard looks like the image below.  Use the **Instance** selector at the top to choose which microservice you wish to view information for.

   ![picture](images/obaas-grafana-spring-dashboard.png)

## Task 8: Explore Jaeger

Jaeger provides a way to view the distributed tracing information that is automatically collected by the backend.  This allows you to follow requests from the entry point of the platform (the API Gateway) through any number of microservices, including database and messaging operations those services may perform.

1. View a trace

   Start the tunnel using this command.  You can run this in the background if you prefer.

    ```shell
    $ <copy>kubectl -n observability port-forward svc/jaegertracing-query 16686:16686</copy>
    ```

   Open a web browser to [http://localhost:16686](http://localhost:16686) to view the Jaeger web user interface.  It will appear similar to the image below.

   ![Jaeger web user interface](images/obaas-jaeger-home-page.png)

   Click on the **Find traces** button to find a trace, open any one and explore the details.
