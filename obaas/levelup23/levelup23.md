# Level Up 2023 Learning Paths

## Introduction

There are different ways to use this Live Lab at the **Level Up 2023** event.  Your hands-on lab session is scheduled for 105 minutes.  Depending on how fast you work through the labs, you may not have time to complete all of the available labs in the room.  But don't worry!  You can always finish the extra labs later on.

If you would like to focus on a particular topic area, here are some recommended paths through the labs you might like to take.  Of course, you are also welcome to do all the labs!  

## Learning Path 1: Focus on Spring Boot development

If you would like to focus on Spring Boot microservices application development with the Oracle Backend for Spring Boot, you could consider taking this path through the labs:

* Complete Lab 1: Provision an Instance
* Complete Lab 2: Setup your Development Environment, up to but not including the optional Flutter task
* Complete Lab 3: Build the Account microservice - this would be the main content for this path
* Optionally also complete Lab 4: Manage Saga Transactions across Microservices - this would expand on what you learned in Lab 3 and covers how to manage long running actions, or sagas, where coordination is required across multiple microservices
* Complete Lab 6: Explore the Backend Platform
* Optionally complete Lab 8: Cleanup

## Learning Path 2: Focus on the backend

If you would just like to learn about Oracle Backend for Spring Boot, and you do not want to dive into the development topics, you could consider taking this path through the labs:

* Complete Lab 1: Provision an Instance
* In Lab 2: Setup your Development Environment, just complete the two tasks to set up **kubectl** and OCI CLI so you can access your Kubernetes cluster
* Complete Lab 5: Deploy the full CloudBank application so that you have some services to look at while exploring the platform
* Complete Lab 6: Explore the Backend Platform - this would be the main content for this path
* Optionally complete Lab 8: Cleanup

## Learning Path 3: Focus on mobile application development

If you would just like to learn about Oracle Backend for Spring Boot, and you do not want to dive into the development topics, you could consider taking this path through the labs:

* Complete Lab 1: Provision an Instance
* In Lab 2: Setup your Development Environment, just complete the last task to set up your Flutter development environment
* Complete Lab 5: Deploy the full CloudBank application so that you have some services to look at while exploring the platform
* Optionally complete Lab 6: Explore the Backend Platform to get an understanding of the overall platform
* Complete Lab 7: Extend the Mobile Application - this would be the main content for this path
* Optionally complete Lab 8: Cleanup
