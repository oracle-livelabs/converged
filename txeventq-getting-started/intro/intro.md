# Introduction

## About this Workshop

This workshop is designed to help you get started with [Oracle Database Transactional Event Queues (TxEventQ)](https://www.oracle.com/database/advanced-queuing/), a messaging platform built into Oracle Database that combines the best features of messaging and pub/sub systems. 

Estimated Workshop Time: 30 minutes

### About Product/Technology

* [Oracle Database Transactional Event Queues](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/23/adque/aq-introduction.html) is a high-throughput, reliable messaging in event-driven microservices and workflow applications that runs within the database. TxEventQ supports multiple publishers and consumers, exactly-once message delivery, transactional messaging, and robust event streaming capabilities.

* The workshop will run on an Oracle Database 23ai container instance, using a docker compatible container runtime.

> Note: the use of a container database is optional. You may use any installation of Oracle Database 23ai, including [Autonomous Database in Oracle Cloud Infrastruction (OCI)](https://signup.oraclecloud.com/) for this workshop.

### Objectives

* The first Lab reviews core concepts of messaging systems and TxEventQ.
* The second Lab demonstrates how to create, start, and manage queues using PL/SQL API for TxEventQ.
* The third Lab shows how to produce, consume, and utilize transactional messaging.
* The fourth Lab reviews additional features of TxEventQ, including queue propagation, error handling, and message delay, and more.

### Prerequisites

* This workshop assumes you have access to a development machine with at least 8 GB of available memory, 2 CPUs, and a docker compatible container runtime.
