# Using OML to predict churn

## Introduction

*Describe the lab in one or two sentences, for example:* This lab walks you through the steps to ...

Estimated Time: n minutes

### About <Product/Technology>
Enter background information here about the technology/feature or product used in this lab - no need to repeat what you covered in the introduction.

### Objectives <optional>

*List objectives for this lab*

In this lab, you will:
* Objective 1
* Objective 2
* Objective 3


*This is the "fold" - below items are collapsed by default*

## Task 1: <what is the action in this step>

(optional) Step 1 opening paragraph.

1. Sub step 1

		![Image alt text](images/sample1.png)

  To create a link to local file you want the reader to download, use this format:

  Download the [starter file](files/starter-file.sql) SQL code.

  *Note: do not include zip files, CSV, PDF, PSD, JAR, WAR, EAR, bin or exe files - you must have those objects stored somewhere else. We highly recommend using Oracle Cloud Object Store and creating a PAR URL instead. See [Using Pre-Authenticated Requests](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Object/Tasks/usingpreauthenticatedrequests.htm)*

2. Sub step 2

4. Example with inline navigation icon ![Image alt text](images/sample2.png) click **Navigation**.

5. Example with bold **text**.

   If you add another paragraph, add 3 spaces before the line.

## Task 2: <what is the action in this step>

1. Sub step 1 - tables sample

  Use tables sparingly:

  | Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | 1 | Some text or a link | More text  |
  | 2 |Some text or a link | More text |
  | 3 | Some text or a link | More text |

2. You can also include bulleted lists - make sure to indent 4 spaces:

    - List item 1
    - List item 2

3. Code examples

    ```
    Adding code examples
  	Indentation is important for the code example to appear inside the step
    Multiple lines of code
  	<copy>Enclose the text you want to copy in <copy></copy>.</copy>
    ```

4. Code examples that include variables

	```
  <copy>ssh -i <ssh-key-file></copy>
  ```
