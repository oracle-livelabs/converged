# Unified Observability

## Introduction

This lab will show you how to view and correlate metrics, logs, and tracing of application and data tiers in a single Grafana dashboard.

Please see the  Unified Observability in Grafana with converged Oracle Database Workshop
for an more in-depth look at this topic including details of the metrics, logs, and tracing exporters.

Estimated Time: 25 minutes

Watch the video below for a quick walk through of the lab.

### Objectives

* Install and configure Grafana, Prometheus, Loki, Promtail, and Jaeger
* Understand single-pane-of glass unified observability using Grafana to analyze metrics, logs, and tracing of the microservices architecture across the application and Oracle database tier.

### Prerequisites

- This lab presumes you have already completed the earlier labs.
 

## Task 1: Install and Configure Observability Software and Metrics with Log Exporters

1. Run the install script to install Jaeger, Prometheus, Loki, Promtail, Grafana and an SSL secured LoadBalancer for Grafana

    ```
    <copy>cd $GRABDISH_HOME/observability;./install.sh</copy>
    ```

   You will see some warning messages related to versions, .kube/config, etc. that may safely be ignored.


2. Run the `/createMonitorsAndExporters.sh` script. This will do the following:
   - Create Prometheus ServiceMonitors to scrape the Frontend, Order, and Inventory microservices.
   - Create Prometheus ServiceMonitors to scrape the Order PDB, and Inventory PDB metric exporter services.
   - Create configmpas, deployments, and services for PDB metrics exporters.
   - Create configmaps, deployments, and services for PDB log exporters.

    ```
    <copy>cd $GRABDISH_HOME/observability;./createMonitorsAndExporters.sh</copy>
    ```

   You will see some warning messages related to configmaps not existing, as this is the initial setup, that may safely be ignored.

## Task 2: Configure Grafana

1. Identify the EXTERNAL-IP address of the `ingress-nginx-controller` service by executing the following command:

       ```
       <copy>services</copy>
       ```

     ![Grafana LB IP](images/grafana-loadbalancer-externalip.png " ")

     Note, it will take a few minutes for the LoadBalancer to provision during which time it will be in a `pending` state

2. Open a new browser tab and enter the external IP of the `ingress-nginx-controller` appended with the `grafana` path as the URL :

   `https://<EXTERNAL-IP>/grafana`

      Note, for convenience a self-signed certificate is used to secure this https address and so you will be prompted by the browser to allow access.

3. Login using the default username `admin` and password `prom-operator` . Do not save the login as part of browser settings if prompted. 

      ![Grafana Login](images/grafana_login_screen.png " ")

   #### Note that if the Grafana console is not used for a period of time, when attempting to access the url again you may encounter a `invalid username or password` error in which case you will need to clear the history/cache for the Grafana console (admin user) to log in again.

5. View pre-configured Prometheus data source:

    Select the `Configuration` gear icon on the left-hand side and select `Data Sources`.

      ![Configuration](images/configurationdatasourcesidemenu.png " ")

    Click the Prometheus option.

      ![Select](images/selectprometheusdatasource.png " ")

    The URL for Prometheus should be pre-populated

      ![Prometheus URL](images/prometheusdatasourceurl.png " ")

    Click `Test` button and verify success.

      ![Test button](images/saveandtestdatasourceisworking.png " ")

    Click the `Back` button.

6. Select the `Data sources` tab and select `Jaeger`

    Click `Add data source`.

      ![Add data source](images/adddatasourcebutton.png " ")

    Click the Jaeger option.

      ![Select Jaeger](images/addjaegerdatasource.png " ")

    Copy and paste the following address in the URL field
    
    ```
    <copy>http://jaeger-query.msdataworkshop:8086/jaeger</copy>
    ```

      ![Jaeger URL](images/jaegerdatasourceurl.png " ")

    Click the `Save and test` button and verify successful connection message.
      ![Save and test](images/confirmjaeger.png " ")

    Click the `Back` button.

7. Add and configure Loki data source:

    Click `Add data source`.

      ![Add datasource button](images/adddatasourcebutton.png " ")

    Click `select` button of Loki option.

      ![Loki Datasource](images/lokidatasource.png " ")

    Copy and paste the following address in the URL field
    
       ```
       <copy>http://loki-stack.loki-stack:3100</copy>
       ```

      ![Loki URL](images/lokidatasourceurl.png " ")

    Create the two Derived Fields as shown in the pictures below.
    For each, first set `Internal link` to enabled and select `Jaeger` from the drop-down list.
    Then copy and paste the following values for each field accordingly...
    
    ####First Derived Field (this is for Kubernetes microservice log to trace correlation)

    Regex:
    ```
    <copy>Span reported: (\w+)</copy>
    ```
    Query:
    ```
    <copy>${__value.raw}</copy>
    ```
    (Optionally to test) Debug log message::
    ```
    <copy>Span reported: dfeda5242866aceb:b5de9f0883e2910e:ac6a4b699921e090:1</copy>
    ```

    ####Second Derived Field (this is for database/ECID log to trace correlation)

    Name:
    ```
    <copy>traceIDFromECID</copy>
    ```
    Regex:
    ```
    <copy>ECID=(\w+)</copy>
