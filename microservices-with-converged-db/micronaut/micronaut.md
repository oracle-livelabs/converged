# Develop a Micronaut GraalVM Native Image app that connects to Oracle Autonomous Database

## Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps to develop with Oracle Autonomous Database and GraalVM using Micronaut.

Micronaut is an open-source JVM-based framework for building Java microservices. It is designed to avoid reflection, thus reducing memory consumption and improving start times. Features are pre-computed at compile time with Ahead of Time (AOT) compilation instead of doing so at runtime as with other Java frameworks.

Estimated Time: 10 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
- Develop with Oracle Database 23ai and GraalVM using Spring Boot

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have completed the setup lab


## Task 1: Cd to project dir and build the project

1. Cd to the following directory of the repos you cloned during setup. For example:

    ```
    <copy>   
    cd $HOME/microservices-datadriven/graalvm-nativeimage/micronaut
    </copy>
    ``` 

## Task 2: Configure Micronaut Data with your Oracle ADB instance details

1.  Edit (using `vi` or similar tool) `src/main/resources/META-INF/microprofile-config.properties` to provide appropriate values for URL, user, and password such as the following.
    Replace values with those found in the workshop `Reservation Information` page and the explicit (eg don't use "~") home directory path as appropriate...
    ```
    <copy>   
    vi src/main/resources/application.properties
    </copy>
    ```
   
    ```
    <copy>
     datasources.default.username=ADMIN
     datasources.default.password=<password>
     datasources.default.URL=jdbc:oracle:thin:@<tnsServiceName>_high?TNS_ADMIN=/home/<myhomedir>/myatpwallet
     datasources.default.walletPassword=<YOUR_WALLET_PASSWORD>
    </copy>
    ```  
    
   *Again note that the values of the password and path to wallet are those that were collected during setup.

## Task 3: Build and run with Java

1. Build and run the following and notice the connection object output after startup, indicating a connection has been made to the ATP instance.

    ```
    <copy>
    mvn clean package -DskipTests
    mvn mn:run
   
    </copy>
    ```
   ![micronaut startup connection success](images/micronautstartup.png)

[//]: # (   ![micronaut connection success]&#40;images/micronaut-conn-success.png&#41;)

## Task 4: Build and run Native Image

1. Now Build the same application into a native image and run it to see the same behavior/output but with faster startup, etc.

    ```
    <copy>
    mvn package -DskipTests -Dpackaging=native-image ;
    ./target/micronaut-graalvm
    </copy>
    ```

Congratulations on connecting your Micronaut app to Oracle Autonomous Database!
