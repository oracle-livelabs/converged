# Fraud alerts on credit card purchase

## Introduction

Process:
Fraud detection is inherently event-driven: each transaction is an event.
Knative Eventing provides a scalable, serverless way to route those events.
CloudEvents provides a standardized event format, enabling portability across services and clouds.
Enables real-time, loosely-coupled, and resilient fraud detection flows.
Great fit for microservices that need to respond to events without being tightly integrated.
