# Develop a Helidon GraalVM Native Image app that connects to Oracle Autonomous Database

## Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps to develop with Oracle Database 23ai and GraalVM using Helidon.

Helidon is a cloud-native, openâ€‘source set of Java libraries for writing microservices that run on a fast web core powered by Java virtual threads.

Helidon also supports MicroProfile, a platform definition that uses Java EE and Jakarta EE technologies.

Estimated Time: 10 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
- Develop a Helidon GraalVM Native Image app that connects to Oracle Autonomous Database


### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have completed the setup lab.


## Task 1: Cd to project dir

1. Cd to the following directory of the repos you cloned during setup. For example:

    ```
    <copy>   
    cd $HOME/microservices-datadriven/graalvm-nativeimage/helidon
    </copy>
    ``` 


## Task 2: Build and run

1. Edit (using `vi` or similar tool) `src/main/resources/META-INF/microprofile-config.properties` to provide appropriate values for URL, user, and password such as the following.
   Replace values with those found in the workshop `Reservation Information` page and the explicit (eg don't use "~") home directory path as appropriate...
    ```
    <copy>   
    vi src/main/resources/META-INF/microprofile-config.properties
    </copy>
   ``` 
   
   ```properties
   javax.sql.DataSource.example.connectionFactoryClassName=oracle.jdbc.pool.OracleDataSource
   javax.sql.DataSource.example.URL=jdbc:oracle:thin:@<tnsServiceName>_high?TNS_ADMIN=/home/<myhomedir>/myatpwallet
   javax.sql.DataSource.example.user=ADMIN
   javax.sql.DataSource.example.password=<password>
   ```


2. Build and run with Java command

    ```
    <copy>   
    mvn package ; java -jar target/com-oracle-helidon-datasource.jar
    </copy>
    ```
  
   Issue this curl command against the application
    ```
    <copy>   
    curl http://localhost:8080/tables
    </copy>
    ```  
   
   Notice the connection made on the server...
   ![helidon-connection](images/helidon-connection.png)

   And the response from the curl request listing tablenames...
   ![helidon-response](images/helidon-response.png)


## Task 4: Build and run Native Image

1. Now Build the same application into a native image and run it to see the same behavior/output but with faster startup, etc.

    ```
    <copy>
    mvn package -DskipTests -Dpackaging=native-image ;
    ./target/com-oracle-helidon-datasource
    </copy>
    ```

Congratulations on connecting your Helidon app to Oracle Autonomous Database!
