Audience: This workshop is meant for both specialists in line of business for financial verticals as well as developers, and also to connect the two.  
For example, the labs of the workshop are named by the financial process with additional information on tech involved, developer notes, etc..

#### All labs can be run individually or wish shared database and can be run either stand alone or on Kubernetes as microservices (all yaml, etc. required are included)

Each lab contains
- Introduction
- Objectives
- Customer References
- Prerequisites
- Low-level, code-level side by side comparison with alternatives
- Migration
- Scaling, Sizing, and Performance
- Walk-through script and video

Estimated Workshop Time: After the initial setup of Oracle database(s) and Kubernetes (if Kubernetes is used), each lab ranges from 15 to 30 minutes and none of the labs depend on any of the others. Entire workshop takes ~5 hours.
