   ![Mongo & Postgress & Kafka to Oracle](images/mongopostgreskafka_vs_OracleAQ.png " ")


### Prerequisites

* Completion of Lab 1: Setup and Lab 2: Microservices Walk-through

## Task 1: Install MongoDB, Postgres, and Kafka, and Deploy Order and Inventory Services that Use Them

1. Install MongoDB, Postgres, and Kafka

    ```
    <copy>cd $GRABDISH_HOME/mongodb-kafka-postgres;./install-all.sh</copy>
    ```

2. Verify all pods and services are running by running the `pods` and `services` shortcut commands.

    ```
    <copy>pods</copy>
    ```

    ![Review Pods](images/kafkamongodbpostgresspods.png " ")

    ```
    <copy>services</copy>
    ```

    ![Review Services](images/kafkamongodbpostgressservices.png " ")

3. Undeploy any existing Order, Inventory, and Supplier Services and deploy the MongoDB, Postgres, and Kafka backed Order and Inventory implementations by copying and running the following commands.

    ```
    <copy>
    for i in order-helidon inventory-helidon inventory-helidon-se inventory-python inventory-nodejs inventory-dotnet inventory-go supplier-helidon-se; do cd $GRABDISH_HOME/$i; ./undeploy.sh; done
    cd $GRABDISH_HOME/order-mongodb-kafka ; ./deploy.sh
    cd $GRABDISH_HOME/inventory-postgres-kafka ; ./deploy.sh
    cd $GRABDISH_HOME

    </copy>
    ```

4. Verify all pods and services are running by running the `msdataworkshop` command.

    ```
    <copy>msdataworkshop</copy>
    ```

    ![Verify Pods & Services](images/console-kafkamongodbpostgres.png " ")

## Task 2: Run Tests on MongoDB, Postgres, Kafka Implementations


1. Add Inventory until there is a value of 10 for sushi.

    ![Get Inventory](images/getinventory10.png " ")

2. Click the `Crash order service after Order is inserted (before Order message is sent to Inventory service)` button.

    ![Crash Order](images/crashorderset.png " ")

3. Click the `Place Order` button to place order `66`

    ![Place Order](images/placeorder66.png " ")

4. The request will hang due to the failure. Refresh the browser, return to the `Transactional` page, and click the `Show Order` button for order `66`.  
    You may see a "connection refused" message as the Order service has crashed and is restarting.

    ![Connection Refused](images/connectionrefused.png " ")

5. Click the `Show Order` button until the order is present. Notice the order is in a pending state and will remain in this state, requiring explicit handling.

    ![Order Pending](images/order66pending.png " ")

6. Click the `Get Inventory` button and notice inventory remains at 10 as expected.

    ![Get Inventory](images/getinventory10.png " ")

7. Click the `Crash Inventory service after Order message is received (before inventory for order is checked)` button.

    ![Crash Inventory Before](images/crashinventorybefore.png " ")
    ![Crash Inventory Before Set](images/crashinventorybeforeset.png " ")

8. Enter order number `67` and click the `Place Order` button.

    ![Place Order](images/placeorder67.png " ")

9. Notice the pending order status. The order will remain pending until the Inventory service restarts and receives the duplicate message deliver for the order.

    ![Pending Order](images/order67pending.png " ")

10. Continue to click the `Show Order` button until the successful order status appears.
    ![Show Order](images/showorder67.png " ")

11. Notice the successful order status due to duplicate message delivery.
    ![Order Success](images/order67success.png " ")

12. Click the `Get Inventory` button and notice inventory has been reduced to correct value of 9.
    ![Get Inventory](images/getinventory9.png " ")

13. Click  the `Crash Inventory service after inventory for order is checked (before Inventory status message is sent)` button.
    ![Crash Inventory After](images/crashinventoryafter.png " ")
    ![Crash Inventory After Set](images/crashinventoryafterset.png " ")

14. Enter order number `68` and click the `Place Order` button.
    ![Place Order](images/placeorder68.png " ")

15. Notice the pending order status. The order will remain pending until the Inventory service restarts and receives the duplicate message deliver for the order
    ![Pending Order](images/order68pending.png " ")

16. Continue to click the `Show Order` button until the successful order status is shown.
    ![Show Order](images/showorder68.png " ")

17. Notice the successful order status due to duplicate message being delivered.
    ![Order Success](images/order68success.png " ")

18. Click the `Get Inventory` button and notice inventory has been reduced to an incorrect value of 7 as the duplicate message delivery has reduced inventory twice for the same order.
    ![Get Inventory](images/getinventory7.png " ")

## Task 3: Deploy Order and Inventory Services that Use Oracle and AQ/TEQ

1. Undeploy MongoDB, Postgres, and Kafka backed Order and Inventory implementations and deploy the Oracle + TEQ/AQ backed Order and Inventory implementations by copying and running the following commands.

    ```
    <copy>
    for i in order-mongodb-kafka inventory-postgres-kafka; do cd $GRABDISH_HOME/$i; ./undeploy.sh; done
    cd $GRABDISH_HOME/order-helidon ; ./deploy.sh
    cd $GRABDISH_HOME/inventory-helidon ; ./deploy.sh
    cd $GRABDISH_HOME/supplier-helidon-se ; ./deploy.sh
    cd $GRABDISH_HOME

    </copy>
    ```

3. Verify all pods and services are running by running the `msdataworkshop` command.

    ```
    <copy>msdataworkshop</copy>
    ```

## Task 4: Run Tests Against Oracle DB + AQ Implementations

   ()

1. Click `Delete All Orders` button and then click `Add Inventory` until there is a value of 10 for sushi.

    ![Get Inventory](images/getinventory10.png " ")

2. Click the `Crash order service after Order is inserted (before Order message is sent to Inventory service)` button.
    ![Crash Order](images/crashorder.png " ")
    ![Crash Order Set](images/crashorderset.png " ")

3. Click the `Place Order` button to place order `66`

    ![Place Order](images/placeorder66.png " ")

4. The request will hang due to the failure. Refresh the browser, return to the `Transactional` page, and click the `Show Order` button for order `66`.  
   You may see a "connection refused" message as the Order service has crashed and is restarting.
   ![Connection Refused](images/connectionrefused.png " ")

5. Click the `Show Order` button until the order is present. Notice the order is null as order `66` was correctly automatically rolled back.
   ![Show Order](images/showordernull.png " ")

6. Click the `Get Inventory` button and notice inventory remains at 10 as expected.
   ![Get Inventory](images/getinventory10.png " ")

7. Click the `Crash Inventory service after Order message is received (before inventory for order is checked)` button.
   ![Crash Inventory Before](images/crashinventorybefore.png " ")
   ![Crash Inventory Before Set](images/crashinventorybeforeset.png " ")

8. Enter order number `67` and click the `Place Order` button.

   ![Place Order](images/placeorder67.png " ")

9. Notice the pending order status. The order will remain pending until the Inventory service restarts and receives the re-delivery of the message from the Order service.
   ![Order Pending](images/order67pending.png " ")

10. Continue to click the `Show Order` button until the successful order status appears.
   ![Show Order](images/showorder67.png " ")

11. Notice the successful order status due to transactional exactly-once message delivery (of the message that was put back on the queue due to implicit rollback resulting from Inventory service crash).
   ![Order Success](images/order67success.png " ")

12. Click the `Get Inventory` button and notice inventory has dropped to the correct value of 9.
   ![Get Inventory](images/getinventory9.png " ")

13. Click  the `Crash Inventory service after inventory for order is checked (before Inventory status message is sent)` button.
   ![Crash Inventory After](images/crashinventoryafter.png " ")
   ![Crash Inventory After Set](images/crashinventoryafterset.png " ")

14. Enter order number `68` and click the `Place Order` button.
   ![Place Order](images/placeorder68.png " ")

15. Notice the pending order status. The order will remain pending until the Inventory service restarts and receives the re-delivery of the message from the Order service.
   ![Order Pending](images/order68pending.png " ")

16. Continue to click the `Show Order` button until the successful order status appears.
   ![Show Order](images/showorder68.png " ")

17. Notice the successful order status due to transactional exactly-once message delivery (of the message that was put back on the queue due to implicit rollback resulting from Inventory service crash).
   ![Order Success](images/order68success.png " ")

18. Click the `Get Inventory` button and notice inventory has dropped to correct value of 8 as the order message was delivered exactly once..
   ![Get Inventory](images/getinventory8.png " ")


You may now proceed to the next lab.
