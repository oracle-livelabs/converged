## Task 1: Insure you have NPM installed

Ensure you have Node Package Manager (npm) installed. You can check this by running:

## Task 2: Run the React Frontend locally

1.  Navigate to the `<REPOS_ROOT_DIR>/financial/react-frontend` directory and run `npm install` and `npm start` to start the React application.
